## Tetris
This repository contains source files of the game Tetris in Java language. 
You can play the game by first cloning or downloading this repository, and move to `src` directory under `Tetris`. Finally, please call **`make`** or **`make play`** command in the terminal if you use MacOS or Linux. For the Windows users, first `javac *.java` and then `java Main`. 
#### How to Play
You can start the game by clicking the `start` button. <br>
During the play, a player can use the following keys:
1. **P**: pauses the game & resumes it
2. **N**: shows or hides the next piece on the top-right corner box
3. **S**: increases the game level
4. **Left/Right arrow**: moves a block left or right
5. **Up arrow**: rotates a block counter-clockwise
6. **Down arrow**: instantaneously drops a block

## Password Encryption/Decription
I worked on this project in order to implement **Multithread** programming. I have used *locks* and *synchronization*. This program basically encripts and decripts user information such as, name, password, and PID.
